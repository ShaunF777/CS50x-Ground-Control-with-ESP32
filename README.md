# CS50x Final Project: Ground Control with ESP32  

Build a micropython app that runs on an ESP-32, allowing scheduled control of a pump & sprinkler system. The ESP32 includes a web application with system information & adjustable schedule parameters for watering intervals.  

## Project Overview  

This project aims to:  
- Save water by disabling the sprinklers when ground moisture is sufficient.  
- Power a 0.35-2kW borehole pump that supplies water to a sprinkler system.  
- Measure pump amperage to protect the pump.

## Parts & Functions  

- **ESP32-Wroom (Do-IT version)**: Main controller for pump monitoring and control.  
- **Relay board 3.3V**: Controls 220VAC outputs up to 10A.  
- **WCS1800 Current board 3-12V**: Measures current from 0 - 25A AC.  
- **5V DC Power Supply (PSU)**: Supplies 5V to the ESP32.  
- **Breadboard Jumpers assorted**: For connections.  
- **USB programming cable**: For programming the ESP32.  
- **AC220 Power socket with 16A plug and lead**: For power supply.  

## Possible Future Additions  

- **ESP32-C3-Mini-1**: Ground moisture & Humidity, Pressure, Temperature monitoring with bme280. Transmission of this information to the ESP32-Wroom using ESPNOW protocol.
